<p>Night Sprint is a free HTML5 browser-based endless runner game created for players who love fast-paced action, neon visuals, and simple yet challenging gameplay. Our goal is to provide an enjoyable gaming experience that can be accessed instantly without downloads, installations, or sign-ups. Whether you are playing on a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone, Night Sprint is designed to run smoothly on modern web browsers.

The game takes place in a neon-lit night environment where players control a runner who must jump over obstacles, avoid collisions, and collect coins to achieve the highest possible score. As the game progresses, the speed gradually increases, making it more challenging and exciting. This endless runner format encourages players to improve their reflexes, focus, and timing skills while having fun.

Night Sprint is built using pure HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. We intentionally avoided heavy frameworks to ensure fast loading times and broad device compatibility. The game is optimized for both keyboard and touch controls, making it accessible to players of all ages. There are no violent, adult, or gambling-related elements in the game, which makes it suitable for a general audience.

Coins collected during gameplay can be used to unlock cosmetic upgrades such as player skins. These upgrades do not affect gameplay balance and are purely visual, ensuring fair play for everyone. Night Sprint does not involve real-money transactions, betting, or any form of gambling mechanics.

We value user privacy and safety. Night Sprint does not require users to create accounts or share personal information to play. Any locally saved data, such as scores or unlocked skins, is stored only in the user’s browser using local storage.

Our mission is to create simple, fun, and safe browser games that anyone can enjoy anytime. Night Sprint is continuously improved based on user feedback, performance optimization, and gameplay enhancements. Thank you for playing and supporting Night Sprint.</p>
