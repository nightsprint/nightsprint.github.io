                    performance without requiring any plugins or additional software. It does not include gambling,
                    betting,
                    or real-money mechanics and is safe for players of all age groups.

                    To protect user privacy, Night Sprint does not require account registration or personal information.
                    Game progress such as collected coins and unlocked skins is stored locally in the user’s browser.
                    This
                    allows players to enjoy the game freely while maintaining a safe and privacy-friendly environment.
